                        Dry Food: He can eat as much dry food as desired at the time insulin is administered. You can
                        leave a full dish of dry food in the garage.

                    <li>
                        Linus loves Greenies. We are restricting treats somewhat, so please stick to no more than 8-10
                        per day. They also clean his teeth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sometimes if he doesn't hear me right away, I whistle and shake the treats bag. Give him a few
                        minutes to come from the woods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lately he has been in the garage on the chess table in the AM and on the front porch in the PM.

                    <li>
                        Insulin: Linus gets 4 units of insulin (Lantus) using the U-100 syringes in the AM and 4 units
                        in the PM.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lantus will be stored in the utility room refrigerator. We will leave syringes on the work
                        bench, along with other items.

                        Linus will occasionally use the litter box in the garage. You may have to scoop it once or twice
                        while we are away. We left the scoop, poop bags, and litter by the chess table.
                    </li>
                    <li>Paper towels, Lysol, dish soap, hand soap all left at the utility sink in the garage.</li>

                    <li>Linus now has an air tag on his collar. You can track him on your phone.</li>
                    <li>
                        It won't track him unless he's near an iPhone, but you should be able to see when he was last
                        near the house and where he is on the property.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Please only play sound if his location shows near you, but you can't see him and have tried
                        treats first. It will be loud and near his ears.

                        With the cat door in the window, Linus is welcome to stay in the garage - just not the utility
                        room with refrigerator.

                        Linus currently does not have any injuries. Feel free to let us know if he gets one or you can
