                We typically administer insulin at 8:30am and 8:30pm so closer to that time is best, but anytime in the
                window is fine. Whatever works for your schedule!

                    <li>
                        <u>Wet Food</u>: Give a half of a can of fancy feast at each time of insulin administration.
                        Open the can, scoop out half into the stainless steel dish we've left on the work bench, put the
                        silicone lid on the can with the other half of food, and place it in the utility room fridge.
                        You can feed him wherever is convenient, so maybe pick a spot that's easy for you to give him
                        insulin. Once you place the dish down, he should stay there.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Dry Food</u>: We will leave a full dish of dry food in the garage. It should last while we're
                        gone, and you shouldn't have to add anything. But you may want to put eyes on it to be sure he
                        didn't tip it over, and if he does need more, there's some in the large white plastic
                        cylindrical container by the bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <u>Water</u>: We will keep a full dish of clean water by the dry food dish, located on the
                        bottom shelf of the shelving unit under the window with the cat door. You shouldn't need to do
                        anything with this, but again, you may want to put eyes on it. If you see it needs attention,
                        you can get fresh water from the utility sink, which is to the left of the garage door.

                    <li>
                        Linus loves treats! You can give him treats or you don't have to. Since he's an outdoor cat, if
                        you don't see him right away when you open the garage door, you can whistle and shake the treat
                        bag. He usually comes within a minute or two, but if you shake the treat bag, he should get a
                        treat.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If he's not interested in the food, you can give him a small pile of treats instead. He needs to
                        eat something when he is given insulin, and it's much easier for you to give him insulin if he's
                        sitting still while eating. So, if he starts to walk away from the wet food dish, give him some
                        treats, and he'll stop and eat them, so you can give him insulin.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                    <li>
                        <u>Insulin</u>: Linus gets 4 units of insulin using the U-100 syringes in the AM and 4 units in
                        the PM. Pull the plunger back until the side of the black stopper nearest the needle stops on
                        the 4 line, and you should be good! No worries if it's not exact. It's best if there are not any
                        large bubbles, so feel free to eject the insulin back into the bottle and try again if you have
                        an air bubble. Or lightly tapping the syringe may remove some smaller bubbles. But if you have a
                        small air bubble, it's not a huge deal, but obviously no air bubbles is best because that's less
                        medication he receives.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Lantus will be stored in the utility room refrigerator. Go through the white interior door near
                        the water heaters to access the utility room, and the white fridge will be in the corner. The
                        insulin will be in a glass bottle, and the top is a membrane, which can be penetrated by the
                        needle of the syringe. It must be refrigerated, so don't forget to put it back in the fridge
                        when you are done!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To operate the syringe -
                        <a

                            >See video</a
                        >. Remove the syringe from the plastic bag of syringes. Take off the white cap that covers the
                        plunger and the orange cap that covers the needle. With one hand, hold the insulin bottle upside
                        down. With the other hand, take the syringe and push the needle through the membrane of the
                        insulin bottle. You need to slide your hand down the syringe a little to then pull back on the
                        plunger until it reaches the 4 mark; the membrane holds the needle pretty well while you do
                        this, so you can hold the insulin bottle in one hand and operate the syringe with the other.

                    <li>
                        To administer the insulin - <a href="#meds-videos" class="scroll-link">See video</a>. While
                        Linus is eating, pick a point about half an inch to an inch down his back from his collar. This
                        is the "scruff" of the cat's neck. Pull up on the skin with your thumb and index/middle fingers.
                        Insert the needle into the skin that is pulled up, just underneath your thumb nail, and push
                        down the plunger. Remove the syringe, place it in the top of the syringe holder and turn the
                        side wheel to discard it. He won't even notice.

                        Linus is very sweet toward humans, but he has an attitude toward other cats and dogs. It is
                        possible that if he smells a cat or dog on you, he will hiss. But he's harmless, so don't be
                        alarmed - he won't hurt you. You may find, however, that washing your hands before you come and
                        after helps keep peace with everyone. Also, I will wipe him down with an allergy dander wipe for
                        you, Erin.

                        Linus will occasionally use the litter box in the garage, but he still usually goes outside in
                        the woods. Given the fact that he rarely uses it and the short time we're gone, don't worry
                        about the litter box. But we do have extra litter, a scoop, and deodorizer down there if you
                        need it... but just don't even worry about it.
                    </li>

                        Paper towels, Lysol, dish soap, hand soap all left at the utility sink to the left of the garage
                        door. You are welcome to use what you need. You can just leave used dishes in the utility sink,
                        and we will wash them upon our return. We're really just concerned about getting him insulin!

                        We will put a garage door opener in the white metal box under the deck stairs by the driveway.
                        It's by the propane tank in the river rock under the long run of stairs. You can open the garage
                        door using the opener, and you won't need to access the house beyond the garage and utility room
                        directly off the garage. Just don't forget to put it back!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Linus typically sleeps in the garage from dawn until late afternoon. So in the morning, you'll
                        most likely find him on the cushion on top of the chess table to the right of the yellow sofa.
                        He may not move very much from that spot, so you can feed him and give him insulin there if
                        that's easiest for you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Around late afternoon, he goes outside. So in the evenings, you'll most likely find him on the
                        front porch. But he'll see your car come down the driveway and hear the garage door open, so
                        he'll most likely come trotting down the driveway looking for you. Sometimes if he's a little
                        slow, I just get all the supplies situated until he shows up. And if he doesn't show up after
                        I'm done, I shake the treat bag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you wait 10 minutes and you don't see him, it's OK to leave. We have skipped an insulin dose
                        before, but while not preferred, he's been fine.
